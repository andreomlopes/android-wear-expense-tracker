Wear Expenses is an Android Wear app that allows you to track all your expenses using either voice and number pad on your Android Wear or easy-to-use interface on your phone. Use your watch to quickly find out how much money you spent or open the app on your phone to view full history.

##Development
When working on Wear Expenses I'm using following tools:
* Android Studio 1.2.11
* Android SDK tools 24.3.2
* Gradle 2.2.1

###Things that Wear Expenses is missing
* Wear app UI fixes for round displays
* Categorizing expenses
* Changing currency
* [Fixing reviews](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lv.bestan.android.wear.expensestracker)

###Merging and releasing
Open an issue if you intend to work on something. Having a discussion prior to coding would make it much easier to merge PRs and release them!
